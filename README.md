PCEN-SNR
========

Per-Channel Energy Normalization for measuring Signal to Noise Ratio.



Installation
------------

The only dependency to PCEN-SNR is the `librosa` package for music and audio analysis, with version 0.6.1 or later.
There are two recommended ways to install librosa. The first way is to use the `pip` package management system, which will automatically fetch `librosa` and its dependencies from PyPI: 

```
pip install librosa
```

The second way is to use an Anaconda distribution of Python, and install librosa via `conda-forge`: 
```
conda install -c conda-forge librosa
```

We refer to the repository of librosa for further details on installation: https://github.com/librosa/librosa/
